This project is designed for the analysis and visualization of meteorological data across Australia. It demonstrates how to process and explore large-scale climate data using Python-based tools, with an emphasis on uncovering trends, anomalies, and patterns relevant to environmental research and decision-making.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through a full data science pipeline:

- Data collection from public sources (e.g., Bureau of Meteorology)
- Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas and NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visual storytelling
- Optional predictive modeling using regression or time-series analysis

It offers a modular and adaptable framework suitable for different weather stations, time periods, and variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.).

## Key Features

- Automated data preprocessing
- Interactive and static visualizations with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly
- Summary statistics and climate variability insights
- Optional forecasting using Scikit-learn or Statsmodels
- Well-commented and beginner-friendly notebook structure

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn / Statsmodels

## Who Is This For?

This notebook is ideal for:

- Students learning data science and climate analysis
- Researchers exploring environmental datasets
- Developers building data-driven weather tools
- Enthusiasts looking to explore Australian weather patterns
